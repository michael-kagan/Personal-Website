                    My name is Michael, and I'm 19 years old.
                    <br>I'm currently studying Finance with a minor in Mathematical Sciences at Binghamton University,
                    <br>where I serve as VP of Fundraising for the business honors college.
                    <br>Using my passion for math and analysis,
                    <br>I began to delve into computer science as a way to express the concepts that so intrigued me.
                    <br>This website serves as a brief introduction to myself, my enterprises, as well as a personal challenge -
                    <br>being one of my first small projects using languages that are suited to web developement.
                    <br>While you may (not) find my facebook interesting,
                    <br>my LinkedIn and GitHub are cool to check out if you want to learn a little more.
